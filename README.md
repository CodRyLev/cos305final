Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
The client was a financial organization who needed to meet security protocols within their systems. Overall I identified their security vulnerabilities and were able to resolve their issues through dependency checks and other methods. It is important to make sure these things are up to date because vulnerabilities can lead to security breaches that can cost the client time and money. 

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I think the hardest part initially was familiarizing myself with the maven system, at first it was not cooperative but I overcame those issues and did what was needed.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To help mitigate security threats I utilized a maven dependency check and fixed the security issues that existed within their systems. 
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
To make sure that the code was functional and no new vulnerabilities existed I utilized a dependency check with adding encryption to the systems. By adding AES-256 and SHA-256 it added layers of needed security within the system.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
The successful implementation of advanced security features within the system.
